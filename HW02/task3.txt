Task 3

We have three functions A, B and C. This functions have different arguments (integer, pointer to integer) 
and different outputs or 

Function A has an integer as argument.

Functions B and C require  a pointer as argument.

1) Function call A. Argument of type integer. We pass argument x to the function A and get 4+1=5. 
This function returns integer 5. We print the value x=5

2) At first we call function A and than we call function B. 
    Call function A: Argument of type integer. We pass argument 5 to the function A and get 5+1=6. 
   
    Call function B: Argument is a pointer to integer. It doesn't matter what what variable we pass to the function. We
     Function B does nothing with variable x. The variable y gets the value 10 bytes from the beginning of the address space. 
    
     We print the value x = 6
   

3) We call function C. 
     Call function C: Argument is a pointer to integer. The function assignes the value 6 to the argument. 
     We pass the adress of variable x to the function and get the value 6.

    We print the value x=6
