Task 1.

1. At first I installed chocolatey.
I didn't know what management does, so I watched a video on YouTube: 
Chocolatey - Windows package manager - Beginners guide

2. I choose programms, which I wanted to install

I wanted to install 3 programs at the same time:
Flashplayer
Notepad++
and
Videoplayer VLC

3. I wanted to avoid to be promted to agree to the licence terms for every program and I added -y
Example:
choco install flashplayeractivex notepadplusplus.install vlc -y



Additional material:
You can also search for updates and install updates for the programs, 
which were installed with Chocalately

Example:
choco upgrade all -y


You can uninstall programms with Chocolately
Example:
choco uninstall
