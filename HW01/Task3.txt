Task 3

a) 
I chose vim text editor

b) 
To save the file and exit the editor I used command 
:x

c) Command:
to paste a section of text:
p or P

to copy a line of text:
y
    
to search for a word in the file:
in command mode type the forward slash (/)  followed by the string (or word) you want to search

It was difficult to switch between command and edit mode.
